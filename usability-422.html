                    With this project, a team and I built and conducted user tests and collected and analyzed both 
                    quantitative and qualitative data to assess users' current experience with the Blaze Pizza 
                    website and make suggestions regarding the most effective changes that could be made.</p>

                <h2>Test Development</h2>
                <p>Before we could collect any data, we first had to construct a test to measure user's current 
                interactions with Blaze Pizza's website. We wrote tasks which required users to engage with 
                most aspects of the site, even those users might not frequently visit, and recorded either 
                time to complete the task (for performance-focused questions) or rating on a Likert satisfaction 
                scale (for preference-based tasks).

            <div class="proj-section">
                <h2>Data Collection</h2>
                <p> We utilized remote, unmoderated usability testing for this assignment. We conducted our 
                    tests through the online platform UserTesting.com, which provides researchers an 
                    audio and screen recording of each subject's testing session in addition to the responses 
                    the participants provide. We were able to review these videos to better understand the 
                    reasoning behind subjects' actions and their opinions on engagement with various elements 
                    of the site.
                </p>
                <p>My team consisted of five members, so different subgroups of us conducted identical tests on 
                    subjects using a variety of devices; two of us conducted mobile tests, one for tablets, and 
                    another two for computers. Because we were using the free version of the UserTesting platform, 
                    we recieved three subjects for each test, or a total of 15 users overall.
                </p>
                <p>My research specifically focused on the mobile version of the website. Although my test alone 
                only measured the experiences of three different individuals, even that was enough to make some 
                specific, justified suggestions on what elements of the webpage require alterations.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="proj-section">
                <h2>Analysis</h2>
                <p>As mentioned previously, we included two different types of tasks in our usability assessment: 
                performance-based tasks, measured with metrics such as completion time or number of errors, 
                and preference-focused tasks, analyzed with use of a Likert scale. For the performance 
                tasks in our test, the quantitative measure we tracked was task completion time. With the 
                preference ones, we found the median value of satisfaction ratings submitted by the participants.
                </p>
                <p>Since this project operated on a pretty short timeline (and was the last project of the 
                semester), my team collected all our data in one spreadsheet file, on separate pages. A summary 
                of my findings is shown below.
                <!-- Since we launched the same tests, we both noticed a few key issues with Blaze Pizza's mobile compatability. -->

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                <p>Overall, users seemed to like the current Blaze pizza website. It allows 
                customers a lot of freedom; for example, when adding a pizza to the cart, all 
                individual ingredients can be easily changed with one click.
                </p>
                <p>Despite this success, there are also many elements of the site which have 
                proven difficult and frustrating to mobile users. The most significant of these 
                are discussed below.
                </p>
            </div>
            

            <div class="proj-section">
              <h2>Next Steps</h2>
              <p>If Blaze Pizza were to utilize our research to guide a website update or 
                  redesign, these are the key suggestions I would offer:
              </p>
              <ul class="takeaways">
                <li>Redesign the merch shop</li>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>While most of Blaze’s website is just fine on mobile devices, the 
                      external merchandise store is irritatingly incompatible. Although I 
                      don’t expect that many Blaze customers visit this specific page 
                      (which is probably why it hasn’t been fixed), those that do will be 
                      immediately deterred by the difficulty of navigating it. Users 
                      complained about a few specific problems within this page: it is 
                      hard to find the shipping price calculator, there is no intuitive 
                      backtracking strategy, and the site doesn’t fit on the screen. Since 
                      this is not a critical page on the site, users will just choose not 
                      to access it rather than switching to a different device or making do 
                      with what they're using.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Add a link to the nutrition calculator from the cart</li>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>All three of my participants suggested this, and it’s one of the 
                      easiest fixes I see potentially being made to the site. Adding a 
                      quick “See nutrition info!” button which would allow users to import 
                      their cart item(s) directly to the nutrition calculator would make 
                      that element of the site much easier to use, thus significantly 
                      increasing interaction with it.

                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Explain the loyalty program on the loyalty page</li>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>Two of my three subjects reported being unable to find much information 
                      on the loyalty program, and the one that did really had to dig deep into 
                      the site (info was on the FAQs page) to find it. If users understand the 
                      details of the program and the benefits they would get, I believe many 
                      more would sign up and thus return to Blaze more often.
                  </li>
                </ul>
