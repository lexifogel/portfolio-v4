                    We recieved the following brief: "U-M would like to create a campus navigation app 
                    to help students. Research question: What are the 
                    biggest challenges that students face in getting around campus and finding what 
                    they are looking for?" We both prepared and conducted experience research
                    to answer this question and determine what they are looking for for use in 
                    an application.</p>

               <h2>Overview</h2>
               <p>This project consisted of five primary phases. First, we constructed an interview guide 
                 and conducted interviews with current U-M students about their navigational experiences. 
                 Next, we combed through our data and identified common themes and patterns across our 
                 sample population. Then, we used these findings to construct a survey which we then sent 
                 out to a larger population of students. After, we used these survey results in conjunction 
                 with our interview data to further understand the behaviors, attitudes, needs, and desires 
                 of our target audience. Finally, we developed a user persona and accompanying scenarios to 
                 encapsulate the mindset of our target user.

                <h2>Interview Stage</h2>
                <p>For the first two weeks of this project, we identified research questions and built
                    an interview guide. Next we conducted user interviews to identify the needs, desires,
                    and current pain points of Michigan students when navigating campus.</p>

                <p>After conducting interviews, my team coded our notes and transcripts to identify recurring 
                themes. After establishing the main patterns, we utilized affinity diagramming to confirm key 
                findings in the data and establish their significance to our research.</p>

              <p>Given the key patterns we recognized in our affinity diagramming, we

                <p>Based on key findings from the user interviews we conducted, 
                we developed user personas we believed represented the target 
                user of our product and wrote cooresponding scenarios to 
                articulate the unique challenges that U-M students face with navigation.</p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                <p>The primary lesson I learned from the prep and interview stages 
                of this project is the importance of being unbiased and thorough. 
                Sometimes subjects need a bit of push to give us the data we need, 
                so asking leading questions and easing them into an interview are 
                very important. But it is also critical to ask questions in a 
                non-judgemental and impartial manner in order to recieve accurate 
                and actionable information.
                </p>
                <p>I would say that the data analysis and survey constructing phases 
                  of this project were the biggest learning experiences for me. Through 
                  affinity diagramming, we learned how to make effective use of qualitative 
                  data to uncover recurring themes. Then, we utilized these patterns to 
                  construct a simple survey which allowed us to recieve more quantitative 
                  information, which was easier to analyze and understand.
                </p>
                <p>I also learned a lot through the persona and scenario development 
                phase of this project. Creating specific identities allowed me to see 
                how our research would be practically applied, and how effective this 
                use would be. From here, it became easy to understand the strengths and 
                shortcomings of both the existing interface, and also our proposed design.

              <h2>Next Steps</h2>
              <p>If we were to actually proceed with development of this application, 
                there are a few key features our research identified as crucial for 
                our target audience.</p>
              <ul class="takeaways">
                <li>More accurate information!</li>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>As it exists, the MagicBus application often lags and is otherwise
                    misleading. Developing an application with real-time information would 
                    better allow students to plan their travel in advance.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Advanced and complex travel planning</li>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>Many students expressed frustration at the inability to plot out their 
                    day's travel in advance. We would like to implement a feature that allows 
                    students to integrate transportation times and modes into their schedule 
                    to ensure a timely appearance at important activities.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Indoor campus maps and resources</li>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>We also discovered through this process that many students feel the 
                    existing resources for finding classrooms and other indoor resources are 
                    insufficient. We would like to incorporate building maps and guides into 
                    this application for more efficient travel once indoors.
