                    This project challenged my team to diagnose all observable usability problems with 
                    Craigslist. Then, we classified these issues and prioritied which should be fixed 
                    first to help define clear next steps for the company.</p>

               <h2>Process</h2>
               <p>The first step of this evaluation was to perform a variety of actions on the site and 
                identify any usability issues we noticed. Next, we went through these problems one by one 
                and determined which of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">
                    Nielson's Heuristics</a> they represented. Finally, we assigned each problem a 
                severity rating according to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/">
                    this scale</a> to determine in what order they should be approached in the redesign 
                    process.
               </p>
               <p>The issues were ranked from most severe to least severe, according to the following scale:
                <ol>
                    <li>Cosmetic problem</li>
                    <li>Minor usability problem</li>
                    <li>Major usability problem; important to fix</li>
                    <li>Usability catastrophe; imperative to fix</li>

                            should indicate that it doesn’t know where you are (rather than 
                            guessing), and give users the option to find their region manually.

                            business development > <span class="italic">biz dev, </span>

                            so many words on the main page distracting the user. 
                            The user's attention is not on one place when they 
                            open Craigslist's site. It makes it stressful to use 
                            as a first-time user to and difficult to understand 
                            how to navigate through. Also, the limited variety of 
                            colors utilized on the site amplifies this effect.

                            is used to indicate proper nouns, categories or sections, etc in 
                            most interfaces. Since Craigslist does not follow these conventions, 
                            items seem to blend together and it is hard to recognize what’s 
                            most important.

                <h2>Results Anaysis</h2>
                <p>I would say that Craigslist’s strengths lie mostly in the recognition 
                    rather than recall and help and documentation areas. One thing that’s 
                    great about Craigslist is that it consistently shows not just the 
                    user’s location, but the path of actions that they took to get to the 
                    current page; for example, if I’m on the pets page, the top navigation 
                    will say “ann arbor > community > pets”, aka showing the location, 
                    category, and relevant subcategory. Another cool thing that Craigslist 
                    does is remember what pages the user has already visited–as is common 
                    in most browsers, it highlights visited pages (links) in purple instead 
                    of the usual blue.
                </p>
                <p>Some weaknesses of Craigslist have to do with the visuals of the site. 
                    The page is very plain/minimally styled, and almost all text is in all 
                    lowercase (even when it shouldn’t be). This can be problematic because 
                    users are used to proper nouns, category names, and beginnings of 
                    sentences or list items being capitalized–this makes them stand out, 
                    and is also the normal convention, so not being that way can be confusing 
                    to new users.

              <h2>Next Steps</h2>
              <p>If Craigslist were to implement this feedback and make substantial 
                  design changes to their site, this is the order in which we'd 
                  recommend:</p>
              <ul class="takeaways">
                <li>Page style</li>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>As it exists, the Craigslist site is not just visually unappealing, 
                    but functionally confusing. We would suggest re-styling the page in 
                    a more modern style, and using a greater variety of colors (or just different 
                    ones than the browser default) to increase contrast between sections and 
                    highlight different elements of the page. Additionally, it would be helpful 
                    to follow proper capitalization conventions to make the comprehension process 
                    more natural for users. I would say that changing the styling of the site 
                    should be one of the top priorities when redesigning -- since the page looks 
                    outdated and there are more functional and modern alternatives, it is very 
                    easy for users to choose something like Facebook marketplace over Craigslist. 
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Memory limitations</li>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>Another high priority should be the website’s memory capabilities –- since 
                      it often forgets the user’s location and has no ability to suggest actions 
                      based on prior interactions (shortcuts), users might be frustrated having to 
                      re-enter information each time they engage.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Visibility of login status</li>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>The main/home page does not indicate if the 
                    current user is logged in, or give any insight 
                    on how to do so. If a user is trying to use Craiglist 
                    to buy or sell products or services (not just browse 
                    the site like we did), it would be take actions which 
                    they later realize were not affiliated with their profile.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
